## Priority

- [ ] Some themes have comments in their json files so we need to find a fix

## Backlog

- [ ] Add support for other programs (waiting for requests)
- [ ] Add option to convert multiple themes in one go
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Achieve zero-dependency (yes i'm crazy)
- [ ] Add cross-platform builds with CI/CD
- [ ] Better setup for the project (formatting, .gitignore, etc...)
